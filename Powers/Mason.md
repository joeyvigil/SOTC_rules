# Mason

MASON- Builds Walls

Power 1: Fortify- When on the defensive side of an invasion, your ships are worth four times their value.

Power 2: Farpoint Field – A “move turn” is different for the masons. You may instead move a stack of ships to an adjacent site leaving behind at least one ship, then that stack may move to an adjacent site leaving behind at least one ship until you either choose to end your turn or you cannot leave behind a ship. (Do this only once)
