# Borg 

“Assimilate”

Power 1: Assimilate- If we win an invasion, then we may place one of our ships in the winning side on one power of the player that lost the invasion. That power is now added to our powers. 

Power 2: De-Assimilate – If we lose an invasion to a player with an assimilated power, we will lose one assimilated power on that player’s power sheet, of their choice.

“We are the Borg. Lower your shields and surrender your ships. We will add your biological and technological distinctiveness to our own. Your culture will adapt to service us. Resistance is futile.” – Star Trek - First Contact (1996)
