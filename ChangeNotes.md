- 9 for 3 players
- possibly pick spots on edges
- thanos choose->defend
- only get one action turn
- too many turns for mason
- 8 or 7 planets in 3 players
- resouces not worth enought
- negotiate + retreat interation unclear
- thans stones are devided equally extara stones put on map
- all interactions between 2 invade-defednse cared need to be hammered out
- thanos: ges 2 powers everyone starts with one
- too many negotiate cards
- asceded should start with 10 or 12?
- outskirts: (outside edge) is useless
- 0-40 too big a difference
