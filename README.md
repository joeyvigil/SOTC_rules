### Definitions
**Ship**- Plastic UFO Looking pieces, can be stacked. A **stack** is a stack of ships. If a ship is **lost** then it is sent to the **graveyard**. Ships Can be lost after an Invasion is resolved.

**Game Board**- Game board is composed of the playing area where ships can occupy a graveyard a draw and discard pile, victory point counter, and unused resources.

**Site**- A location that a ship can occupy. On the game board these are located at the center of the circles or at the corners.

**Settlement/Colony**- A planet site that is occupied by a ship(s). The Player who owns the ships, is colonizing the planet. Colonizing a planet counts as one Victory point. A planet with a planetary fortress on it counts as 2 victory points.

**Cards**- **Invasion cards** are played when one players ships attacks another players ships. Both players play an invasion card face down. **Reinforcements cards** can be played afterwards by players involved and not involved in the invasion. **Victory point cards** give that player an additional victory point.

**Resources**- There are two types of resources Minerals and Gas. Resources are obtained at the beginning of each turn. They can be spent to obtain ships, cards, planetary fortresses and other enhancements.

### Goal
The winner is the first player to reach 10 Victory Points. Victory points are obtained in the following ways:
1. Having your ships colonizing a planet. (+1)
2. Having your ships colonizing a planet with a planetary fortress. (+2)
3. Having cards that award victory points. (+1)
4. Least Ships in Graveyard. (+2)
5. Most Cards in hand. (+2) 
6. Purchasing them. (+1)

### Setup 

Randomly collect the indicated number of Victory Point Planets (purple), Gas Planets (green), and Mineral Planets (blue) and place them randomly on the circles of the game board. 

Players | VP Planets | Gas Planets | Mineral Planets
------- | ------- | ------- | ------
2 | 7 | 3 | 3
3 | 10 | 4 | 4
4 | 10 | 4 | 4
5 | 13 | 3 | 3
6 | 19 | 2 | 2

Players randomly draw two alien power cards, choose one that they will play as during the game and discard the other. All players reveal their alien power card at the beginning of the game.

Determine turn order by dice roll or other random method.

First player places 4 ships in one site on the outside edge of playing board, 2nd player follows until all players have placed all their ships.

Players are given a starting hand. Starting hand size is 7 cards.

If a player is involved in an encounter but does not have an encounter card, then they may discard any number of cards in their hand, then draw from the deck until they have 7 cards.

### Player Turn
Player turn consists of the four steps shown below.

1. Collect Resource
2. Spend Resources
3. Move
4. Invade

**Collect Resources**
Player collects once resource of their choice + one additional gas for every gas planet they occupy + one mineral for every mineral planet they occupy.

**Spend Resources**
Players may spend their minerals & gas, standard purchases that can be made by all alien races are shown below:

Purchase | Mineral Cost | Gas Cost 
------- | ------- | ------- 
Two Ships | 1 | 0 
Draw Card | 0 | 1 
Planetary Fortress | 2 | 2

**Move**
Player may move 1-4 ship(s) from one site to an adjacent site unoccupied by another player.

**Invade**

Place the invasion token to indicate which stack of your ships is invading another players stack of ships. These two stacks must be adjacent to one another. Both players play an invasion card face down and flip it over at the same time. The winner of the invasion is the player with the higher total of ships in their stack + invade attack number. A Negotiate, Sabotage, Quash and Retreat card can also be played in an invasion. 

Clarification on different invasion scenarios are shown below:

**Attack, Attack** - Add totals of each side (attack card number + ships in stack + reinforcements ), winner is the higher of the two. If tie occurs, no ships are lost on each side and neither side wins.

**Attack, Negotiate** - Player who played attack card Wins. Player who played the negotiate card picks one card from the other players hand for every ship they lost.

**Attack, Sabotage** - Player who played attack card Wins. 

**Attack, Quash** - Player who played attack card Wins.

**Attack, Retreat** - Player who played attack card Wins.

**Negotiate, Negotiate** - No one wins.

**Negotiate, Sabotage** - No one wins.

**Negotiate, Quash** - No one wins.

**Negotiate, Retreat** - No one wins.
