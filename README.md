### Definitions
**Ship**- Plastic UFO Looking pieces, can be stacked. A stack is a stack of ships. Maximum stack size is 4 (unless otherwise stated). If a ship is lost then it is sent to the graveyard. Ships are most often times lost by being on the losing side of an encounter.

**Hexagon**- Game board is composed of 19 hexagons designated by a red circle in the center.  

**Site**- A location at the center or corner of a hexagon. Ships can occupy sites by being on top of them. Planet Sites contain a planet. Void Sites contain empty space.

**Settlement/Colony**- A planet site that is occupied by a ship(s). The Player who owns the ships, is colonizing the planet. Joint Colony/Settlement may occur when more than one playerâ€™s ship(s) is on a planet Site. 

**Cards**- Cards indicate when they are played. 

**Resources**- There are two types of resources Minerals and Gas. Resources are obtained by occupying hexagons with the corresponding tokens. 


### Goal
Settlers of the cosmos is a space strategy board game for 3-6 players. The winner of the game is decided by the first player or players to own five Colonies at once.

### Setup 
Randomly collect the indicated void planet pieces and planet pieces indicated by the number of players. Arrange them randomly on the red circles on the board. 
 
Next collect the number of Blank Tokens, Mineral Tokens, and Gas Tokens for the planet hexagons. Mix up these tokens and place them randomly on the planet pieces. Collect the number of Blank Tokens, Mineral Tokens, and Gas Tokens for the void planet hexagons. Mix up these tokens and place them randomly on the void planet peices. The chart below indicates the number of hexagons and tokens for each game.

Using Chart:  (number planet pieces or void planet peices) = (Blank Tokens) + (Mineral Tokens) + (Gas Tokens) 
 
 
Players	Planet Pieces	Void Planet Pieces 
2	8 = 8 + 0 + 0	11 = 5 + 4 + 2
3	10 = 10 + 0 + 0	9 = 0 + 6 + 3
4	13 = 7 + 4 + 2	6 = 0 + 4 + 2
5	16 = 4 + 8 + 4	3 = 0 + 2 + 1
6	19 = 1 + 12 + 6	0 = 0 + 0 + 0

Players randomly draw three races, choose one that they will play as during the game, and discard the others. Place this card face down and reveal it either at the start of the game or during its first use. Shuffle deck of cards. First player determined by dice roll or some other random element. 2nd player is to the left of 1st player, 3rd player is to the left of 2nd player etc. (i.e. Clockwise turns)

First player places 1-4 ship(s) on a planet of his choice, then places 1-4 ship(s) on any of the surrounding planets. This would mean that if they placed 4 ships on a planet and 4 ships on the surrounding 6 spaces, than that player placed 28 ships (4x7) on their first turn. 

Second player then places ships, then 3rd, ext. After the last player places ships, the turn order is then reversed going from last to first. All players can place up to a total of 32 ships (4x8). 

Max stack size of ships is 4

Players are given a starting hand. Starting hand size is 7 cards. 

If a player must play an invade card, but does not have one, than that player discards all cards in hand and draws 7 more.

Players now take turns starting with the first player going clockwise. Game ends when a player has 5 colonies. 

### Player Turn

Resources- Gain one resource for each resources spot you occupy. Trade resources with other players. Spend resources. 

Player may choose to move a stack of ships (may do this twice), or invade an adjacent stack of ships. If that player loses the invasion, than their turn is over. If they win it or moved ships, they get another turn (max 2 turns). Possible turns shown below.

Move
Player may move 1-4 ship(s) from one site to an adjacent site unoccupied by another player. Do this twice.

Invade
Player may invade an adjacent site. Place the invasion token indicating which ships are being invaded by who. Players that own ships in the five adjacent sites may ally, adding to the total ships on that side. Main Players are the person invading, and the person being invaded. Allies are players that choose to ally, and indicate that they are doing so by moving their pieces to the side of the main players. Offense is the side invading. Defense is the side being invaded.  

After the Invasion token is placed down and the players on the sides of the token decide if and who they want to ally with; both main players play an Invade Card face down. At the same time both players flip it over. 

Note: If one of the main players has ships on the sides of the invasion token, he may ally with himself, adding to his total. 


Winner of the Invasion is determined by the chart shown below.
Cards Played	Outcome
Attack-Attack	Offensive and defensive side add up the following: Main player ships on that side + Allie ships on that side + number on card. The side with the higher total wins the Invasion (defense wins on tie), the other side losses the invasion and all ships on that side are lost. The winner can move one stack of ships after (usually to the site that ships were just destroyed) Ally ships return to their original spots
Attack-Defend	The side that played the attack card wins the invasion, the other side losses the invasion and all ships on that side are lost. The winner can move one stack of ships after (usually to the site that ships were just destroyed). Defense text takes priority to these events.
Defend-Defend	Both sides win the invasion. Read card events.
